# Digital Clock using Multisim
A simple digital clock with 6 displays and shows the time in the format hh:mm:ss.
There are 3 push buttons:
1. RESET - It resets the seconds.
2. MIN - It increments the minutes.
3. HOUR - It increments the hours.

Hours are from 1-12 and the dot (decimal point) after hour tells about AM/PM. When the time is AM, the dot is off. When the time is PM, the dot is on.
